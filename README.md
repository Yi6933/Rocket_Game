1.3. Verify Installation

Open Command Prompt/Terminal: Type python --version (or python3 --version on some systems) to verify that Python is installed correctly and to check the version number.
Step2:>>> Extract Files and View Projects<<<
2.1. Locate Your Files

Find the Project Files: Navigate to the directory where your project files are stored. This could be a .zip file, .tar.gz, or any other compressed format.
2.2. Extract the Files

Windows: Right-click the compressed file and select “Extract All…” to unzip the contents.
macOS: Double-click the compressed file to extract it.
Linux: Use the tar command for .tar.gz files:
bash
Copy code
tar -xzf filename.tar.gz
For .zip files, use:
bash
Copy code
unzip filename.zip
Step3:>>> Open and Explore the Project<<<

3.1 Navigate to the Project Directory: Use File Explorer (Windows), Finder (macOS), or cd command (Terminal) to enter the directory.
Open Project Files: Use a text editor (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm, Sublime Text) or an IDE to open and explore the project files. Look for files like README.md, requirements.txt, or main Python scripts (.py files) to understand the project's structure and details.
